        <h1 class="title">100 Tools That Will Increase Your Website Sales</h1>
        <h2>Tag Management Tools</h2>
        <p>
          Tag management tools are like a big control center for a website. They
          help you manage and swap out little bits of code called tags. These
          tags can do lots of things, like track how many people visit your
          site, what they look at, and if they buy something.
        </p>
        <p>Here's why they're great for boosting sales:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Easy Updates:</strong> You can change tags without needing
              a tech wizard, which means you can quickly add new sales trackers
              or ads.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Better Tracking:</strong> They help you see what's popular
              on your site, so you know what your customers like and can sell
              more of it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Faster Website:</strong> Too many tags can slow down your
              site, but tag managers keep it running fast, so shoppers don't get
              frustrated and leave.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Less Mistakes:</strong> It's easy to mess up when you have
              lots of tags. Tag managers help keep things tidy, so everything
              works right.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Personal Touch:</strong> They let you show visitors ads or
              deals that match what they're interested in, making them more
              likely to buy.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So, tag managers help make your website smarter, faster, and more
          friendly to shoppers, which can lead to more sales! ðŸ›’ðŸ’¨
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let's take a look at some of the top tag management tools that
          can help you achieve this:
